                        <p>To understand our users, we conducted user interviews with entrepreneurs, inventors, and creative individuals who had experience with ideation and collaboration. We found that our users were looking for a website that was easy to use, allowed them to connect with other ideators, and provided them with tools to help them refine their ideas. They also wanted a way to share their ideas without the risk of them being stolen.

                        <p>There are several collaboration websites available in the market that cater to ideators, including: IdeaScale, MindMeister, MURAL, Aha and Slack. Each of these collaboration websites offers unique features and benefits to ideators. IdeaScale and Aha! are more focused on idea management and strategy, while MindMeister and MURAL provide visual collaboration tools. Slack, on the other hand, is more focused on real-time communication and team collaboration. To stand out in the competitive market, a collaboration website for ideators needs to offer a unique value proposition, such as stronger security measures for idea protection, or a more user-friendly interface.

                        <p>Based on our research, we created a user persona for our target users, Janet. Janet is a marketing manager for a tech startup in the Bay Area. Janet is highly creative and is always coming up with new ideas for her company. She's an ideator who loves to brainstorm and collaborate with others to bring her ideas to life. She's been looking for a platform where she can share her ideas and connect with like-minded individuals who can help her bring her ideas to life.

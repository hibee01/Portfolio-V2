                    <p>We conducted a series of user interviews and surveys to understand customers' needs and pain points when it comes to mobile banking. Our research revealed the following key insights:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Customers want a simple and intuitive application that enables them to quickly and easily access their accounts and perform transactions.</li>

                    <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
                    <p>We conducted a competitive analysis of similar mobile banking apps to find out how they met the needs of their customers. We found that the most successful apps were those that provided a variety of features, such as account management, bill payments, and money transfers. These apps also had user-friendly interfaces that were easy to navigate and allowed users to access their accounts quickly.</p>

The wireframes included clear call-to-action buttons, easy navigation, and a consistent color scheme. Once the wireframes were finalized, we created high-fidelity mockups to showcase the final design of the app. The mockups included images and text that reflected the bank's branding and message.</p>
